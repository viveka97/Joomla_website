VMSYSTEM_COMUSER_REDIRECT="Redirect Joomla to VirtueMart registration"
VMSYSTEM_COMUSER_REDIRECT_TIP="In most cases you want to use the registration redirect to VirtueMart, since the customer has to fill in the address. The VM registration also attracks less Spam. If you like to use the Joomla registration because you have other extensions that need less information, you can switch this off."
